There is a relatively small set of fundamental concepts or principles that underlie techniques for extracting useful knowledge from data. These concepts serve as the foundation for many well known algorithms of data mining. Moreover, these concepts underlie the analysis of data-centered business problems, the creation and evaluation of data science solutions, and the evaluation of general data science strategies and proposals. Accordingly, we organized the exposition around these general principles rather than around specific algorithms. Where necessary to describe procedural details, we use a combination of text and diagrams, which we think are more accessible than a listing of detailed algorithmic steps.

The book does not presume a sophisticated mathematical background. However, by its very nature the material is somewhat technical—the goal is to impart a significant understanding of data science, not just to give a high-level overview. In general, we have tried to minimize the mathematics and make the exposition as “conceptual” as possible.

What kind of concepts we are going to explore:
1. Concepts about how data science fits in the organization and the competitive landscape, including ways to attract, structure, and nurture data science teams; ways for thinking about how data science leads to competitive advantage; and tactical concepts for doing well with data science projects.
2. General ways of thinking data-analytically. These help in identifying appropriate data and consider appropriate methods. The concepts include the data mining process as well as the collection of different high-level data mining tasks.
3. General concepts for actually extracting knowledge from data, which under gird the vast array of data science tasks and their algorithms.
